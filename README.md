# GatherSage2
Adds skill-level and item information to WoW gathering tooltips

GatherSage2 is a re-write of the original GatherSage addon. Almost all the original GatherSage functionality made its way into GatherSage2 with much more added.

GatherSage2 shows required levels to mine, pick, smelt, or skin resources (vein, deposit, ore, animal, plant, etc). The tooltip shows skills for which the resource can be gathered.

It also shows your current skill, how many skill ups you've gained since logging in, and the difference between the skill you need to work with the resource and the skill you have currently.

The information is dislpayed in the tooltip when you mouse over a resource in the world, minimap, inventory, auction house, mailbox, guild bank, and pretty much anywhere the item can be displayed.

It will also show if that resource has a chance of yielding special items (such as stone, gems, or other herbs).

A lot of testing has gone into making sure GatherSage2 does not interfere with other addons.

There is a readme.txt file that contains detailed information on GatherSage2.
